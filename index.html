    <h1>A Star Over 5000 Miles Away</h1>

    <p>Shohei Ohtani began his professional baseball career in 2012 after being selected by the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. Ohtani originally wanted to go to the MLB straight out of high school, but his team of choice, The Los Angeles Dodgers, wouldn’t let him be a 2-way player. As a result he signed with the Fighters and would spend the next 5 years with them. In that time, Shohei led the team to Japan Series Championship while adding a Pacific League Most Valuable Player, being a 2 time Pacific League best pitcher and a 5 time Nippon Professional Baseball All-Star. After a jaw dropping 5 years in the NPB, the MLB and NPB came to an agreement allowing Shohei to sign with any MLB team he choses. Shortly thereafter, The Japanese Native chose the Los Angeles Angels as his next destination and the rest is history.

      <h1>(wOBA)ught the Best in the League</h1>

      <p>Weighted On-Base Average, more commonly referred to as wOBA, is a statistic that takes into consideration how a player gets on base. Means that a double is more valuable than a single regardless of the situation. SU Professor Jeremy Losak says “The value of wOBA is that it doesn't penalize players for the game environment that is around them.” This is important because the Los Angeles Angels were a bottom 15 team in total runs scored. Because of this, Shohei’s hits wouldn’t result in a lot of run production. wOBA takes the team element out of it and stats that if the team was average, he would have been much more effective than he already was. That is not to take away from Ohtani’s .300/.650/1.000 slash line. All it says is that Shohei could have been even more productive than he was, which is hard to comprehend.</p>

      <h1>(ERA)ned His Spot in the Big Leagues</h1>

      <p>Earned Runs Average or ERA is a Statistic that explains how many runs a pitcher gives up per 9 innings. It is the primary stat to determine how good a pitcher is. In Shohei's 6 seasons in the MLB, the only time he has been above league average were years that he was injured. Other than that Shohei has been at least 1 point lower than league average ERA. Ohtani’s 3.14 ERA in 2023 was 7th best in all of baseball and was a crucial part in Shohei obtaining his 2 Most Valuable Player Award. </p>

    <div class="war">

      <h1>You (WAR)n’t Ready for this, Were You?</h1>

      <p>Wins Above Replacement or WAR is a stat that compares players to their counterparts at that same position. SU Professor Jeremy Losak said “War effectively says how much more valuable are you in terms of producing wins.” he adds that Runs are converted to win similar to wOBA and how many wins does a certain player gain for their team compared to a “Triple A Alternative.” Traditionally this is easy because players only Pitch or hit. So they only have to deal with one formula. But because Shohei does both he has to add the value of his pitching WAR and hitting WAR to get an absurd number. His inflated WAR from both sides of the ball means that even with a war in 2020 that was oin the negative, through just 6 seasons, Shohei has a higher Career war than MLB legends, Shawn Green, Ken Griffey, and Adam Jones.</p>

    <h1>The Greatest to ever Do it? </h1>

    <p>It is still very early in Shohei Othani’s young career but he is already getting comparisons to Babe Ruth, one of the greatest players this world has ever seen. The flashing lights and media attention has made Shohei a Superstar in the baseball world and he is already reaping the benefits. The 29 year old signed a 10 year, $700 million dollar contract with the cross town rivals the Los Angeles Dodgers a week ago. With a new team and a new environment only time will tell if Shohei can keep up the elite level production. Based on the stats above and what he has done in just 6 years, it's a very big possibility Shohei is the greatest player to ever grace a Baseball diamond.
